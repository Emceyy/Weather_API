# Weather API

This is a web app that allows you to get the current temperature of any location by entering the city, country, village, etc. It uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch the weather data and displays it on a simple web page.

## Installation

To run this app, you need to have Node.js installed on your machine. You also need to create a free account on OpenWeatherMap and get an API key. Then, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository or download the zip file.
2. Navigate to the project folder and run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your API key as `API_KEY=your_key_here`.
4. Run `node app.js` to start the server.
5. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to see the app.

## Usage

To use the app, simply enter a location in the input field and click on the "Go" button. The app will display the name of the location, the current temperature in Celsius, and an icon indicating the weather condition.
